For the output of the durationa nd energy codes the first two columns give the correspoding event and waveform information. You need to be wary of times of station power outages where there will only be 6 waveforms instead of the full 12. This will throw off the organization of the data into tables. For the Sakurajima data note that in first pass the waveforms 7-12 have gaps between 656-1218, 2030-2188, and 2660-2778 and to adjust the column rows appropriately. Further the power was out on station SAKA during the 2660-2778 gap, the 2030-2188 gap, and the 946-1218 gap so those columns (although listed as waveformms 1-6 need to be shifted to 7-12). Station B was out for those events between 656-946.
